<h1>Data Structure Projects</h1>

The Data Structure Project is a number of projects that are implemented using a specific data structure topic. Abstract data types, Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hashing, Graph algorithms and more. They consist of hundreds of lines of code. 

<h1>Delivery Android App Project</h1>

The Android App Project is an android app made from the Delivery Project in the above Data Structure Projects code. 

<h1>Project Cancer Classification</h1>

The Cancer Cell project is a project done in my data science class. The first part of the project gene data to cluster the data using K-means method and hierarchical clustering methods. The second part of the project is used to build a classifier that will predict if the patient has Type 1 Breast cancer or Type 2 cancer using mRNA data. The classifier used is a linear SVM classifier and the data is reported in a confusion matrix. 

<h1>Algorithms</h1>
This file contains two programs. The Bandwith Minimizaiton problem is an implementation of a backtracking algorithm The bandwidth problem takes as input a graph G, with n vertices and m edges (ie. pairs of vertices).The goal is to find a permutation of the vertices on the line which minimizes the maximum length of any edge. 

The second program will take in the number of edges number of vertices and edges and print out the connected components of an undirected graph. Breadth first search is the algorithm used to find the list of connected components
